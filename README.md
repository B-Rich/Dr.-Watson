# Dr.-Watson
Dr. Watson is a Ruby project which will solve the cluedo board game. My aim is that all I will have to do is write down the suggestions made by players and the application will tell me what three cards are inside the envelope.
Once the above has been completed and finds the answer in the shortest number of turns possible, my next aim will be that the program will tell the user what suggestions he or she should make.
